# Engagement Model
# Xelar Engagement Model

This explains how Xelar works with clients from first contact to delivery.

## 1. Discovery & AI Roadmap Call (Primary CTA)
A 30-minute session where we:
- Learn about the business
- Understand the current tools
- Identify bottlenecks
- Determine goals
- Suggest 2–3 automation opportunities
- Estimate timeframes
- Build a mini roadmap

This is the best way for businesses to begin with Xelar.

## 2. Business Process Audit
We review:
- Current workflows
- Data sources
- Software tools
- Manual tasks
- Communication channels
- Reporting needs

Deliverable:
- Clear automation & AI adoption plan.

---

## 3. Implementation Phase
We build:
- n8n/Zapier/Make workflows
- Automation scripts
- AI assistants / RAG systems
- Data pipelines
- Dashboards

Most implementations take between 1–8 weeks.

---

## 4. Testing & Optimization
We test each workflow:
- Error handling
- Data accuracy
- User experience
- Scalability

We refine the flows until stable.

## 5. Handover or Ongoing Support
Options:
- Full documentation & handover

   - Define security and access requirements

3. **MVP Build** (2-6 weeks, depending on complexity)
   - Build core workflows and integrations
   - Implement basic portal (if required)
   - Set up authentication and access control
   - Create initial reports and dashboards

4. **Iterate** (1-4 weeks)
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders
   - Refine workflows and features
   - Add additional integrations
   - Enhance security and governance

5. **Launch** (1 week)
   - Final testing and validation
   - User training and documentation
   - Go-live support
   - Handover to client

6. **Support** (Ongoing, optional)
   - Monitoring and maintenance
   - Bug fixes and improvements
   - Adding new features
   - Performance optimization

**Timeline Ranges:**
- **MVP:** ~2-6 weeks depending on integrations and complexity
- **Full Rollout:** ~6-12+ weeks for comprehensive systems with multiple workflows, portals, and integrations

**Important:** Timelines depend on:
- Data access and API availability
- Complexity of integrations required
- Security and compliance requirements
- Number of workflows and features
- Client feedback cycles

**Pricing:** All projects are scope-based. We provide detailed estimates after the discovery workshop and roadmap phase. No fixed pricing—each project is customized to your needs.
