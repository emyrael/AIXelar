Xelar helps businesses accelerate growth by combining **automation, analytics, and AI strategy** into one unified service.

## Secure Client Portals

Xelar can build secure client portals that give your team and clients a private, controlled interface for accessing automation and data. We can also implement WhatsApp automation, webhooks, or other communication channels based on your specific requirements.

**Portal Features:**
- Private URL access (e.g., `/monitoring` or `portal.clientdomain.com`)
- Upload and approve data pulls
- Trigger workflows on-demand
- View real-time KPIs and dashboards
- Download reports (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- Set custom alerts and notifications
- Role-based access control (RBAC) - different users see different data
- Optional SSO/MFA for enhanced security

**Security Posture:**
- Authentication (login/password or SSO)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) - admins, managers, viewers have different permissions
- Optional Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Encrypted data in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Encrypted data at rest (database encryption)
- Audit logs tracking who accessed what and when
- Data retention policies controlled by the client

**Positioning:** Xelar is not just chat—it's a connected system + automation. We build secure, integrated platforms that connect your data sources, automate workflows, and provide controlled access to insights and actions.

## How Xelar Differs from Generic AI Tools

Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other AI assistants are excellent for one-off questions and quick tasks. However, Xelar builds always-connected systems designed for ongoing business operations.

Xelar provides live data connections that update automatically, scheduled reports that run daily or weekly, and real-time monitoring. Generic AI tools require you to upload files each time and provide disconnected answers.

Xelar implements role-based access control so you can define who sees what data. You get complete audit logs tracking all access and actions. Your data stays in your controlled environment, not sent to third-party services.

Xelar builds automated workflows that run consistently every time. Reports use standardized KPI calculations. Generic AI tools may give different results with each prompt, requiring manual work each time.

Xelar gives you full control over data retention policies. We don't train models on your data. You choose where data is stored. Generic AI tools may use your data for training, have unclear retention policies, and use shared infrastructure.

Xelar supports multiple users with different roles, approval workflows, shared definitions of KPIs, and team dashboards. Generic AI tools are typically single-user experiences without collaboration features.

Generic AI tools are great for one-off questions and quick tasks. Xelar's connected systems are designed for ongoing business operations, automated reporting, secure data access, and team collaboration where governance, security, and repeatability matter.
