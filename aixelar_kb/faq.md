## PRICING QUESTIONS

### **How much does AIXelar charge?**
There is **no fixed price** because every project is different.  
The cost depends on:
- The type of automation or AI system  
- The tools involved (n8n, Zapier, APIs, databases, etc.)  
- The number of workflows or pipelines  
- The complexity of your business processes  
- Whether you need AI assistants, RAG systems, dashboards, or data pipelines  

### **Can you give me an estimate?**
Yes — but only after understanding:
- Your industry  
- The tools you use  
- The problem you're trying to solve  
- The workflows we need to build  

This is why we recommend a **30-minute AI Strategy & Roadmap Call**, where we break down your needs and give you a realistic effort estimate.

### **Do you offer subscription packages?**
Not at the moment.  
Because each business has unique workflows, pricing is based on **scope**, not templates.

### **Do I need to pay upfront?**
Payment terms are agreed upon during the roadmap discussion.  
Simple workflows may require upfront payment; larger projects may have milestones.

### **Do you charge for the roadmap call?**
No. The AI Strategy Call is currently **free**, and it helps us understand your business and propose a tailored plan.
